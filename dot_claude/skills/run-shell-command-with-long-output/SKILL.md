# Run Shell Commands With Long Output

Runs command through copilot CLI to get just the gist of output.

## Instructions

Ask copilot CLI to run the command for you and to provide you with just the details you need from the command's output. Use the `copilot -p "<instructions for copilot>" --model claude-haiku-4.5 --allow-all-tools` command.

Example:

```sh
copilot -p "Build the app with command 'just build' and tell me whether the result is successful(then just say 'success'), or not (then provide all the available details on what the issue is). Do not try any fixes or modifications!" --model claude-haiku-4.5 --allow-all-tools
```
