#### add an alias so that "v" would invoke "nvim"  

I'll help you add an alias for `v` to invoke `nvim`. Since you're using fish shell, we'll add this to your fish config.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to add the alias:

~/.config/fish/config.fish
```fish
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
alias v="nvim"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After adding this, you can either start a new fish shell session or run:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Now you can use `v` to open files in neovim, for example:

```fish
v myfile.txt
```

#### how to create aliases in fish shell?  

In fish shell, you can create aliases in two ways:

1. Temporary alias (only for current session):
```fish
alias v="nvim"
```

2. Permanent alias (add to config file):
```fish
echo 'alias v="nvim"' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

To make the alias take effect immediately after adding it to the config file, run:
```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

To list all current aliases:
```fish
alias
```

To remove an alias:
```fish
functions --erase v
```

Remember that fish shell aliases are actually functions, so they're more powerful than traditional shell aliases. You can even create more complex functions with arguments if needed.

#### add alias for "v" to run "nvim  

I'll add the alias for `v` to run `nvim` to your fish config file.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

~/.config/fish/config.fish
```fish
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if status is-interactive

end
=======
if status is-interactive
    alias v="nvim"
end
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the alias inside the interactive check block, which is a good practice since aliases are only needed in interactive shells.

After making this change, you can either start a new fish shell session or run:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Now you can test it with:

```fish
v ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
