#### add an alias so that "v" would invoke "nvim"  

I'll help you add an alias for `v` to invoke `nvim`. Since you're using fish shell, we'll add this to your fish config.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to add the alias:

~/.config/fish/config.fish
```fish
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
alias v="nvim"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After adding this, you can either start a new fish shell session or run:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Now you can use `v` to open files in neovim, for example:

```fish
v myfile.txt
```

#### how to create aliases in fish shell?  

In fish shell, you can create aliases in two ways:

1. Temporary alias (only for current session):
```fish
alias v="nvim"
```

2. Permanent alias (add to config file):
```fish
echo 'alias v="nvim"' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

To make the alias take effect immediately after adding it to the config file, run:
```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

To list all current aliases:
```fish
alias
```

To remove an alias:
```fish
functions --erase v
```

Remember that fish shell aliases are actually functions, so they're more powerful than traditional shell aliases. You can even create more complex functions with arguments if needed.

#### add alias for "v" to run "nvim  

I'll add the alias for `v` to run `nvim` to your fish config file.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

~/.config/fish/config.fish
```fish
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if status is-interactive

end
=======
if status is-interactive
    alias v="nvim"
end
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the alias inside the interactive check block, which is a good practice since aliases are only needed in interactive shells.

After making this change, you can either start a new fish shell session or run:

```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Now you can test it with:

```fish
v ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

#### Add an alias that invokes gemini command when I run ai  

Of course. To create an alias that runs the `gemini` command when you type `ai`, we'll need to add a configuration line to your shell's startup file.

Since you haven't specified which shell you are using (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`), I will create a generic `aliases.sh` file for you. You can then "source" this file from your shell's specific configuration file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).

I will create a new file `aliases.sh` with the alias definition. To use it, you'll need to add a line like `source /path/to/aliases.sh` to your shell's configuration file, replacing `/path/to/` with the actual path to where you save the file.

Here is the new file:

aliases.sh
```
alias ai='gemini'
```

> Processing your request...  

Of course. I can help you fix your `config.fish` file.

The line you've pointed out has a couple of issues in the context of the Fish shell:

1.  The comment `//` is not valid in Fish scripts. Comments in Fish start with a `#`.
2.  The `export` command is used in shells like `bash` or `zsh`. The Fish equivalent is `set -x`.
3.  More importantly, to set an environment variable for just a single command, the best practice is to use the `env` utility.

I will correct the alias to use `env`, which will set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable only for that specific `gemini` command's execution. I will also remove the comment as you requested.

Here are the changes for `config.fish`:

#### it still doesn't work. When I run "ai", it prints nothing, I just land at another shell prompt. But when I invoke "gemini" it runs gemini app  

Hello! I can certainly help you with your `config.fish` file.

It seems like your `ai` alias isn't working as expected. You've described that running `ai` gives you a new prompt with no output, while `gemini` works correctly on its own.

This behavior strongly suggests that `gemini` is a shell function, not a standalone executable file. The `env` command can only run executable files found in your `PATH`, it cannot execute shell functions. When your alias runs, `env` fails to find an executable `gemini` command and exits, which is why you see no output. When you run `gemini` directly, the fish shell finds and executes the `gemini` function correctly.

To fix this, we should replace the alias with a short fish function. This new function will use fish's own features to set the environment variable temporarily for just the `gemini` command. This is a more robust and idiomatic way to achieve your goal in fish.

Here is the updated `config.fish` file:

#### move this new function to functions directory  

Of course. I can move the `ai` function into its own file inside a `functions` directory.

This is a great idea. The Fish shell automatically finds and loads functions from files located in `~/.config/fish/functions/` (and other function directories). By convention, each file should contain one function, and the filename should match the function name with a `.fish` extension (e.g., `ai.fish`).

This practice keeps your main `config.fish` file cleaner and more organized.

Here are the changes:

1.  I will create a new file named `functions/ai.fish` to hold your `ai` function.
2.  I will remove the `ai` function definition from your `config.fish` file.

Here are the updated files:
