#### when I run neovim, I see a huge "LAZYVIM" text displayed, in the startup dashboard. I don't want to see that  

To remove the "LAZYVIM" text from the Neovim startup dashboard in LazyVim, you'll need to modify the LazyVim configuration. Here's how to do it:

1. First, we need to locate and edit the LazyVim dashboard configuration file.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for the change:

~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/alpha.lua
```lua
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        header = {
            type = "text",
            val = {
                "██╗      █████╗ ███████╗██╗   ██╗██╗   ██╗██╗███╗   ███╗",
                "██║     ██╔══██╗╚══███╔╝╚██╗ ██╔╝██║   ██║██║████╗ ████║",
                "██║     ███████║  ███╔╝  ╚████╔╝ ██║   ██║██║██╔████╔██║",
                "██║     ██╔══██║ ███╔╝    ╚██╔╝  ╚██╗ ██╔╝██║██║╚██╔╝██║",
                "███████╗██║  ██║███████╗   ██║    ╚████╔╝ ██║██║ ╚═╝ ██║",
                "╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚══════╝   ╚═╝     ╚═══╝  ╚═╝╚═╝     ╚═╝",
            },
=======
        header = {
            type = "text",
            val = {},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the ASCII art "LAZYVIM" text from the dashboard header by setting the `val` to an empty array.

To apply these changes:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/alpha.lua
```

After making this change, restart Neovim and the "LAZYVIM" text should no longer appear on the startup dashboard.

Note: If you don't have the alpha.lua file in that exact location, you might need to search for it in your LazyVim configuration directory. The path might vary depending on how you installed LazyVim.
